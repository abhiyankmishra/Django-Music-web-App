# Django-Music-web-App
Django web app, made for Song Streaming by using cascading filters for Songs(category, subcategory )

we have made a seperate login page for admin where admin will be having all the rights to delete,add any new category ,subcategory, song  directly into the database after login.
After login admin will be redirected to a interactive dashboard  where the admin will be having all the seperate interactive interfaces  for all the operations which will directly effect the 
database as well as the data showing on the the app, where user can directly play the songs with an interactive mp3 player , and if the user doesn't want to play the song by using those filters
then the user can also search for their favourite song using the search bar which will directly fetch that particular song using the sql query.
